# ADIS16448 IMU Library for FIRST Robotics and the RoboRIO

## Introduction
This example library was written to give mentors, students, and engineers a starting point for using a very high-performance 10 Degree-of-Freedom (DoF), calibrated Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). This sensor packages gyroscopes, accelerometers, magnetometers, and a barometer in a small, robust package perfect for high performance robotics (such as FRC). 

These software libraries provide the user (you) with:
- Raw sensor outputs - X-Y-Z Gyroscope, Accelerometer, Magnetometer, and Barometer
- X-Y-Z gyroscope angles calculated by means of loop integration
- AHRS (Pitch, Roll, Yaw) calculated using complementary and simplified Kalman (Madgwick) filters. More information can be found [here](http://www.x-io.co.uk/open-source-imu-and-ahrs-algorithms/)

Tutorial videos, how-to guides, and additional resources can be found at [http://www.analog.com/first](http://www.analog.com/first/)

## What programming languages are supported?
The IMU driver currently supports all three official FRC languages (C++, Java, and LabVIEW). Raw sensor rate outputs, accumulated sensor outputs, and Kalman/Madgwick outputs are supported for all languages. 

**New for 2018:** Recent updates to the 2018 FRC libraries have dramatically improved sensor performance and greatly reduced CPU load!

## What do I need to get started?

In order to use the software, you will need access to a RoboRIO and the ADIS16448 MXP Breakout Board. This software is based on the FRC 2018 software distribution and relies on the WPILib libraries to interface with the IMU. Previous (pre-2018) versions of LabVIEW and WPILib libraries are **not** supported.

Plug in the expansion board as shown below. **Be careful to not offset the connector!!** If installed correctly, the Power LED should turn on once power is applied to the RoboRIO.

## How do I use the IMU with my programming language?

## A Shout-Out to the RoboBees

Thank you very much to Team 836, The RoboBees for providing the FIRST community with an excellent AHRS example!
